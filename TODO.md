## TODO

- Groups are probably what most users are going to want to use to configure all
  this. The closest to the OpenID spec would be via adding extra scopes that add
  the data required to the token and then map back to a group. Imagine:

  ```yaml
  user: email
  group: https://myapp.example.com/group
  ```

  The downside to using this kind of configuration is that it'll need to be
  handled in the provider backend and it is unclear how easy that'll be. It is
  possible in auth0, so I'll go down this route for now.

- Is there a way to do FPS on a per-session basis with prometheus? Naively the
  way to do it would be to have a per-session label value, but that would be
  crazy for cardinality.
