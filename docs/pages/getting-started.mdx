# Getting Started

As part of this getting started guide, you will:

- Grant your email address access to the cluster.
- Install kty on your cluster.
- Test it out!

<Callout type="info">
  You can run kty outside of a cluster, but it is a little more complex to get
  setup because of permissions. Check out the
  [off-cluster](/installation#off-cluster) instructions for more details.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Get a k8s cluster. [k3d][k3d] is a convenient way to get a cluster up and
  running fast. Follow their installation instructions and create a default
  cluster.

## Install the CLI

Binares are available on the [releases page][cli-download]. If you have
homebrew, you can install with:

```bash copy
brew install grampelberg/kty/kty
```

<Callout type="info">
  `ssh` is all you need to use kty. The CLI is optional, but makes installation
  and management a little easier.
</Callout>

## Setup Permissions

Just like `kubectl`, kty delegates authorization to Kubernetes RBAC. The email
address you use to login needs to be granted access to the cluster. If your
organization already uses email addresses for access, you can skip the install
step - make sure you verify you've got access though.

To grant access to your email, you can use the `kty` CLI. It will apply a
`ClusteerRoleBinding` that associates your email address with the provided role.
In this example, we're using `cluster-admin` because it is everywhere and an
easy way to get started. You can change this to another role, anything with the
[minimum permissions](/architecture/access-control#authorization) in fact. Run:

```bash copy
kty users grant cluster-admin me@example.com
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you'd like to verify the YAML or apply it youself, pass `-o yaml` to the
  command.
</Callout>

You can verify that this worked and you have the minimum permissions required by
running:

```bash copy
kty users check me@example.com
```

This command runs a `SelfSubjectAccessReview` against your cluster. If you want
to use `kubectl` instead, you can run:

```bash copy
kubectl auth can-i list pods --as me@example.com
```

## Install on your cluster

While it isn't required that you run `kty` on your cluster, it takes care of the
dependencies. To install the server and associated configuration such as
`ClusterRole` and `Service` resources, run:

```bash copy
kubectl create ns kty && \
  kty resources install -n kty
```

<Callout type="info">

You can pass `--dry-run` to see what's happening or pass the output to
`kubectl apply -f -` yourself. If you'd like to install using a different
method, such as helm, see the [installation](/installation) instructions.

To clean these resources up, you can run `kty resources delete -n kty`.

</Callout>

Verify that this is up and running successfully by checking that the pod has
started up:

```bash copy
kubectl -n kty rollout status deploy server
```

Once the pod has started up, you'll want to make sure there's an IP address that
can be reached. This will also add `cluster.kty.dev` to your `/etc/hosts` file
so that it is easy to get to the server in the future.

```bash copy
kubectl -n kty get service server --output=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' \
  | awk '{print $1 " cluster.kty.dev"}' \
  | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

<Callout type="warning">

If the load balancer isn't getting a public IP address, there's other ways to
connect to the server. You can port forward using `kubectl`:

```bash copy
kubectl -n kty port-forward service/server 2222:2222
```

This is not something you'd want to do in production, but it's a quick way to
see what you can do with kty.

</Callout>

## Test it out

```bash copy
ssh -p 2222 me@cluster.kty.dev
```

## Next Steps

- Exec into a pod. You can use VI keybindings to navigate and enter to select
  the pod you want. Go to the `Shell` tab and you'll be able to pick the command
  to exec and then be shell'd into the pod directly.

- `scp` some files out of a container:

  ```bash copy
  scp -P 2222 me@cluster.kty.dev:/default/my-pod/etc/hosts /tmp
  ```

- Check out [usage](/usage) for more information on everything that you can do.

- You can [bring your own provider](/installation#bring-your-own-provider) if
  the default provider don't work for you. This would be a great way to
  configure groups or use other types of logins if your organization uses
  something other than Google or Github.
