# Getting Started

1. Download the [cli][cli-download] and add it to your `$PATH`.
1. Get a k8s cluster. [k3d][k3d] is a convenient way to get a cluster up and
   running fast. Follow their installation instructions and create a default
   cluster.
1. Grant your email address access to the cluster. Choose `cluster-admin` if
   you'd like something simple to check out how things work. For more details on
   the minimum possible permissions, read the [Authorization][auth] section. The
   email address is what you'll be using to authenticate against. It can either
   be the one associated with a google or github account. Note, the ID used for
   login and the providers available can all be configured.

   ```bash
   kty users grant <cluster-role> <email-address>
   ```

1. Start the server.

   ```bash
   kty --serve
   ```

1. SSH into your cluster!

   ```bash
   ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 2222 me@localhost
   ```

From this point, here's a few suggestions for things to check out:

- Start a new pod. It'll show up in the dashboard immediately!

- Exec into a pod. Select the pod you want and go to the `Shell` tab. You'll be
  able to pick the command to exec and then be shell'd into the pod directly.

- Follow the logs. Logs for all containers in a pod are streamed to the `Logs`
  tab when you've selected a pod from the main list.

- `scp` some files out of a container:

  ```bash
  scp -P 2222 me@localhost:/default/my-pod/etc/hosts /tmp
  ```

- Use your own [OpenID provider](/installation#bring-your-own-provider).

Note: you'll want to install on-cluster to use the tunnelling functionality.
Check out the [helm](/installation/helm) docs for a quick way to do that.
