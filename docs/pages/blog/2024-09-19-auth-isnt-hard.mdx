title: 'Stop Making Kubernetes Auth Hard'

I've spent most of my time working with Kubernetes being afraid of auth. I
understood how RBAC works and I knew that `.kube/config` is what's required to
talk to an API server, but that's pretty much where my understanding stopped.
Configuring the API server to use an auth plugin, getting tokens or certificates
and setting up plugins made me think that it was all a monumental task. Just
getting the environment setup correctly for myself _was_ a monumental task.
Well, as part of implementing kty's oauth support, I've been forced to figure
out how it all actually works. And, as turns out, it doesn't need to be nearly
as complex as I thought it was.

## TL;DR

Use OpenID and grant groups or users the correct permissions in your cluster.
Your organization already has an OpenID provider in place. Google, GitHub, Okta
(and many more) can all be used. That's it, that's all you need. Don't bother
with IAM, service accounts or any of that other stuff. Those are all reasonable
for machines - not for users.

Take it from the folks over at Robinhood. Karen Tu and Sujith Katakam took their
existing complexity and simplified it down to OpenID. The result was a system
that is easier to maintain and keep secure. They've got a [Kubecon
talk][robinhood-talk] that walks you through their journey and is well worth
watching.

If you'd like to know how to do this yourself, jump down to
[the instructions](#how-do-i-do-this-myself). However, I'd recommend reading
through the rest of this post and demystifying what's going on behind the
scenes. It is a good way to contextualize how all the pieces fit together.

## Authentication

Let's start out by splitting "auth" into two parts: [authentication][authn] and
[authorization][authz]. Authentication is how you prove who you are. The result
of the authentication process is an identity that can be used to see what you
are, or aren't authorized to do. If we didn't actually care about verifying your
identity, authentication could be nothing more than sending the username in
cleartext to the API server. Obviously, we'd like a solution that is a little
bit more secure than that.

[authn]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication
[authz]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization

Kubernetes has a [whole bunch][auth-plugins] of ways to authenticate. Because it
is the easiest to understand, let's start with the static token file. This is
equivalent to having a password. You put the token (aka "password") into the
file and then associate it with a username. If this sounds like `/etc/passwd`,
that's because it is! Each request sent to the API server contains your token as
a header. The API server looks up the token in its file and maps that to a user
or set of groups. Very similar to sending the username to the API server, but
now we've got a piece of shared data, the token, that verifies the identity.

Open ID Connect (OIDC) gets rid of the pre-shared secret and instead uses some
[cryptography magic][pki] to do the same thing. This allows for identity to be
created in a central location (a provider) and subsequently verified by anyone.
When you authenticate with an OIDC provider, the end result of the process is an
[ID token][oidc-id-token].

[pki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography

The ID token is a [JSON web token][jwt] (JWT) that contains a bunch of
information about your identity. The information in this token is effectively
key/value pairs that are called "claims". Each claim is a piece of data that the
provider has verified.

The token is signed using the private key of the provider and can be verified by
anyone with the public key. Most importantly, OIDC providers publish their
configuration so that anyone can verify the token. If you're interested in
what's in that configuration, check it out for the [default
provider][oidc-config] in kty.

[jwt]: https://jwt.io/introduction

With an ID token and the way to verify it in hand, the API server can extract an
identity from the token and use that as part of RBAC to understand what you're
allowed to do. The association between the token and either groups or users
happens as part of a claim. If you've got a JWT, you can see the claims in your
token by going to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) and pasting it in. Here's a token
that I've gotten for kty:

```JSON
{
  "iss": "https://kty.us.auth0.com/",
  "aud": "P3g7SKU42Wi4Z86FnNDqfiRtQRYgWsqx",
  "iat": 1726784050,
  "exp": 1726820050,
  "sub": "github|123456",
  "email": "me@my-domain.com"
}
```

For this token, we could configure the API server to map the `email` claim to a
user. This is just like the token file from above! Instead of using the
pre-shared secret as the mapping, we've used the public key from the OIDC
provider.

## Authorization

Here's where it gets interesting. Now that we have a verified identity,
authorization can take place. We'll check a list of rules (or roles) and test
whether the identity can do the action requested. Kubernetes' [role based access
control system][rbac] doesn't care about how you authenticated. If the API says
you're a user - then you are that user. All it cares about is your identity and
what roles that identity is bound to. Let's look at a simple role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: view
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
```

Any identity that is bound to this role can get, list or watch pods in any
namespace. How does an identity get associated with this role? That's where the
`ClusterRoleBinding` comes into play.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: User
    name: me@my-domain.com
```

Assuming that we're still talking about the token from above, this role binding
associates all the permissions in the `view` role with the user
`me@my-domain.com`. That's it! We've authenticated the identity and then
verified that it can do some actions on the cluster. As RBAC is opt-in, you
start off with no permissions and need to be granted them to do anything. There
are some policies that come by default. In fact the `view` cluster role is one
that comes out of the box (but simplified in this example). To see what can be
granted, make sure to check out the [documentation][rbac].

For extra credit, you can also bind roles to groups. We can configure a claim
from the JWT to be a group in addition to the email address. Imagine granting
permissions on a cluster based on which teams a user is a part of. In fact, you
can map almost anything from someone's GitHub profile directly over to a group.
This way, you can setup permissions once and manage membership entirely through
your OIDC provider. When using groups, the role binding ends up looking a little
different:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: my-team
```

[rbac]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/

## How do I do this myself?

We've implemented OIDC support directly into kty. This means that you can `ssh`
into your cluster without managing any SSH keys. You're presented with a login
screen that goes through OIDC to verify your identity. That identity uses the
`email` claim by default to map an external identity onto a `kind: User` defined
in your role bindings. Check out the [getting started guide](/getting-started)
and see how simple OIDC can make accessing your cluster.

To get OIDC working directly with `kubectl`, you'll want to check out
[kubelogin](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin?tab=readme-ov-file), it is a
plugin that will do the OIDC dance for you. Add the plugin and your cluster's
connection information to `~/.kube/config` and you're good to go. Note that if
you can't make the modifications required for the API server, you'll want to use
an [oidc-proxy](https://github.com/TremoloSecurity/kube-oidc-proxy). Luckily,
most Kubernetes solutions (like [EKS][eks-oidc] or [GKE][gke-oidc]) support OIDC
out of the box.

## Bringing it Together

So, what does this all mean? Well, it means that we've now got a central
location to manage access to our cluster. If you're using groups, membership
when the token is granted is mapped to a role binding that grants exactly what
someone needs to work with your cluster. The IDs can be user friendly, so you
can read through the `RoleBinding` YAML to understand what's allowed or not. If
you're using `kty`, you don't even need any plugins or configuration! Your users
can use `ssh` and immediately get access to the cluster.

Please don't be afraid of auth! Don't continue to use incredibly complex systems
consisting of multiple plugins, webhooks, tokens and certificates. They're all
hard to setup and/or easy to break. After all, security everyone can follow is
the best security. Say no to services that require blanket permissions like the
Kubernetes dashboard. Use OIDC and make sure that users have exactly the
permissions they need.
