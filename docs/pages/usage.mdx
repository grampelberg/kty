# Usage

## SSH

To get to the dashboard, you can run:

```bash
ssh anything@my-remote-host-or-ip -p 2222
```

The provided username is not used as your identity is authenticated via other
mechanisms.

## Ingress Tunnel (`ssh -L`)

You can forward requests from a local port into a resource on the remote
cluster. The supported resources are `nodes`, `pods` and `services`. See the
[authorization][auth] section for details on required RBAC.

To forward port 9090 on your local system to 80 on the cluster, you can run:

```bash
ssh me@my-cluster -p 2222 -L 9090:service/default/remote-service:80
```

The first time 9090 is accessed, a connection will be made. Pay attention to the
dashboard as any errors establishing this session will be reflected there.

The connection string format is `<resource>/<namespace>/<name>`. As nodes are
not namespaced, the format is `<resource>/<name>`.

Unlike the API server proxy, this works for any TCP service and is not limited
to HTTP/HTTPS. For example, you can ssh directly to a node in the cluster with:

```bash
ssh me@my-cluster -p 2222 -L 3333:no/my-node:22
```

With that running in one terminal, you can run this in another:

```bash
ssh my-node-username@localhost -p 3333
```

## Egress Tunnel (`ssh -R`)

You can forward a remote service on your cluster to a port on your local host.

To forward port 8080 on service `default/kty` to port `9090` on your local
system, you can run:

```bash
ssh me@my-cluster -p 2222 -R default/kty:8080:localhost:9090
```

The format for service definitions is `<namespace>/<service-name>`.

## SFTP

The cluster is represented by a file tree:

```bash
/<namespace>/<pod-name>/<container-name>/<file-path>
```

For the `nginx` pod running in `default`, you would do something like:

```bash
scp -P 2222 me@localhost:/default/nginx/nginx/etc/hosts /tmp
```

It can be a little easier to navigate all this with an sftp client as that'll
render the file tree natively for you.
